## :memo: About project

This project is an interactive Q&A system designed for AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions. Users can create rooms and share the room link with others to join. Within the room, participants can submit questions and like existing ones. Each like boosts the question's ranking, pushing the most popular questions to the top for the room owner to answer.

- **Question Submission and Likes:** Participants can submit questions and like others' questions. Each like increases the visibility of the question, moving it up in the ranking to help prioritize the most relevant questions for the room owner.
- **Real-Time Interactions:** All interactions, such as submitting questions, liking them, and marking questions as answered, are handled in real-time using WebSocket, ensuring a dynamic and instant experience.

## ‚ö° Technologies Used

- **React.js 19:** The latest version of React is used to develop the user interface.
